Tracks are displayed on the right, and control buttons appear for each one. \n \n--- \n \n## Header Buttons \n\nAt the top right of the interface: \n \n`Play All`&nbsp;`Together`&nbsp;`In Order`&nbsp;`Loop`&nbsp;`Mix`  \n`Loop All`&nbsp;`Off`&nbsp;`On`  \n`Stop All`&nbsp;`Find`&nbsp;`Help` \n \n### Button Descriptions \n \n**Play All**  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Together** - Plays all visible tracks simultaneously. Limited to the first five visible.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**In Order** - Plays all visible tracks one after the other.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Loop** - Plays all visible tracks one after the other, then starts over.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Mix** - Plays all looping tracks continuously, and all other tracks at random intervals. Use to create a custom soundscape. Stopped by `Stop All`. \n\n### Mix Rate\n[`Mix Rate:`][`↻`][`10s`][`60s`]  \n- Set the **minimum** and **maximum** interval (in seconds) between randomly played tracks when using [`Mix`] mode  \n- Click `↻` to reset to the default range (10–60 seconds)  \n- These settings affect how frequently non-looping tracks are triggered in a mixed soundscape  \n- Looping tracks are not affected by this timing \n \n**Loop All**  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Off** - Disables loop mode for all visible tracks  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**On** - Enables loop mode for all visible tracks \n \n**Stop All** - Stops all currently playing tracks. Also use to stop a Mix.  \n**Find** - Search all track names and descriptions for the keyword. All matching tracks will be assigned to a temporary album called **Found**. You can then switch to the Found album to quickly view the results. To clear the results, simply delete the Found album using the Utility panel. \nIf you input \"d\" as the search term, it will create a temporary playlist of any duplicate tracks, grouped by name.  \n**Help** - Displays this help page. Click **Return to Player** to return. \n \n--- \n\n[... rest unchanged ...]
